**The 25mm CUT SHEETS went on 2026-09-03**; `--bore` is untouched and takes any value,
and only the sheets kept here are 10mm.

**The two 25mm VIEWERS stayed** - `ribbon-torus-bore25-45deg-R76.html` and
`ribbon-traced-octagonal-trumpet-bore25-45deg.html`. They went briefly with the sheets,
because a name filter cannot tell a 25mm sheet from a drawing of a 25mm instrument, and
came back the same day: torus-octagonal and trumpet-octagonal are both still here, and
those pages are their only 3D views. **They keep the 25 in their names because the
objects are 25mm.** Renaming them to survive a filter would be the filter deciding what
is true.

## Working in this repository

A laser-cutting build repository. `ribbon_bore.py` is the generator and the
authority; the SVG beside it is its output and is regenerated, not edited.
Everything is 3mm birch on an xTool P2S.

This is the **third** way these repositories cut a bore, and the three are not
variations on each other:

| | curve | section at a turn | why it exists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bore-generator` | 90° lattice turns | +41.4% | fits a walk into a box |
| `torus-octagonal` | a circle, 45° facets | +8.2% | a closed constant-section loop |
| here | any planar curve | +3.5% at 30° | constant section on a smooth curve |

## The geometry, in one paragraph

Sweep a rectangle along a curve **in a plane**, with one axis normal to that
plane, and the duct has two flat faces and two cylindrical ones. Flat cuts from
the sheet; cylindrical does not, because 3mm birch will not bend to these
radii. So the curved pair are faceted, and the facet angle is the only dial:
the section is exactly `bore × bore` along a facet and `bore² / cos(φ/2)` at
each mitre.

**The centreline polyline IS the facet plan.** There is no separate faceting
step, so there is nothing for it to disagree with. `walls()` offsets it and
asserts which side came out inner, because the sign depends on which way round
the centreline was written and getting it backwards silently swaps every panel
length in the cut list.

## The walls are offset to their FACES, not their centrelines

`wall_off()` is `(BORE + THICK)/2`. A wall is `THICK` thick and its slot is
centred on the offset line, so offsetting to `BORE/2` puts the wall *faces* at
`(BORE - THICK)/2` and the airway comes out **`BORE - THICK`** wide. This
generator did exactly that until 2026-09-03: a bore asked to be 10 x 10 was cut
**7 x 10**, 70mm2 against 100. Reported by the author from a measurement of a
finished part.

**The check did not catch it because the check was wrong in the same way.** It
measured the distance between the two offset polylines and called that the
bore. It now subtracts one wall thickness and is named *the airway is the bore
along every facet*, which is the thing that matters — a check named for the
quantity it measures is harder to write against the wrong one.

The height was right throughout: a panel's shoulders bear on the cheeks' inner
faces, so shoulder-to-shoulder is the bore. Only the width was wrong, which is
why the measured section was 10 x 7 and not 7 x 7.

`wall_off()`, `cheek_off()` and `band()` are **functions**. They were constants
for one run, and `--bore=25` kept the 10mm figure — caught immediately by the
corrected airway check reporting 15mm of error, which is what a check named for
its quantity buys you.

## What limits a bend, and it is not what you would guess

The inner wall is the centreline offset inward by `bore/2`, so there is no bore
at all below `R = bore/2`. **But the tooth runs out long before the geometry
does.** A Boxes.py tooth is `2 × thickness` and does *not* scale with the bore —
the same fact that forced `pin_width()` in `bore-generator` to floor at the
tooth. At the 10mm bore and 30° facets:

    R 15   inner panel 5.09mm   shorter than one tooth
    R 20   inner panel 7.67mm   still no room for shoulders
    R 25   inner panel 10.26mm  fits, 2.13mm shoulders

R 25 is why this coupon is R 25. Coarser facets need less radius, finer facets
need more: 20° wants R 35, 15° wants R 45. `build()` refuses rather than
drawing a panel that cannot hold its tab.

## A half-circle advances 2/pi of its own length

Which is the whole reason the serpentine has three lobes and long straight
runs. A 1000mm run of half-circles wants **637mm of width** whatever the lobe
count, and the bed is 600 — dividing it finer only claws back the lead-in and
shortens the panels until they cannot hold a tooth. The straight verticals are
what make it fit, because they buy length in y where there is room.

**Solve the radius against this generator's own faceted centreline**, never
against a smooth arc: an inscribed chord is **1.14% short** of the arc it
spans, so a radius picked from the arc comes out 11mm long over a metre.

## The geometry is worked out y-up and flipped once, in flip()

SVG's y runs down, so writing y-up coordinates straight out renders the shape
upside down — a hump becomes a trough, and a cut file that does not look like
the thing it makes is a cut file you check twice. `flip()` negates y at the end
of `centreline()` and **nowhere else**, so every offset, normal, mitre and label
angle downstream is computed in the flipped space and comes out right. Glyphs
are not flipped: `label()` already draws them for SVG.

The flip reverses handedness, which broke one thing that had assumed it: the
outward direction for a panel's number was a left normal with a sign flip for
the inner wall, and that is only right for one handedness. **122 of 504 engraved
points landed off the material.** It is now measured — from the centreline
segment's midpoint out to the wall segment's — which has no handedness to get
wrong.

## Long panels get more than one tooth

`teeth(L)` gives `floor((L - 2*SHOULDER + TOOTH) / (2*TOOTH))`, alternating
tooth and gap of equal width. One tab in a 90mm straight run is a hinge: it
pivots about the tab and the seam opens. Every coupon panel is short enough to
want exactly one, so the coupon's cut geometry did not move when this arrived —
checked by comparing the cut groups as position-independent shapes, which is
the only comparison that means anything once the packer may have reordered
them.

## A traced centreline is kept with how it was taken

`--trace=` draws a bore measured off somebody else's cut file. Only
trumpet-octagonal needs it: its sheet is a hand-authored band, and the curve
behind it is not written down as parameters anywhere.

`traces/octagonal-trumpet.json` carries the stations **and the provenance** -
which path in which file, which transforms were composed onto it, how the
midline was taken, and what was measured. A traced number without that is a
number nobody can check.

**Three things fell out of the trace that were not assumed**, and they are why
it is trustworthy: the strip is 31.2mm wide, which is 25mm of airway with a 3mm
wall each side; the turns are +-45 degrees, the same facet angle as the torus;
and the total turning is 0, so its mouth and its bell face the same way. Do
not read that as the requirement - it is a measurement of the shape that was
traced. The turn a mouthpiece and a bell want is 180 degrees, mouth and bell
facing opposite ways, which is --shape=reversing.

It is a trace, so it is not exact. The width scatters 30.7 to 35.5mm about a
nominal 31.2, two turns are still 5 degrees off square, and two stations a few
millimetres apart had to be merged - the shortest real facet on this channel is
2*R*tan(22.5), about 62mm, so 12mm was a safe threshold. **If the parameters
ever turn up, generate it instead and delete the trace.**

## A closed ring is a shape too

`--shape=torus` is a closed regular ring of FACET turns, and `offset()` mitres
a closed polyline's seam like any other vertex. Without that the two facets
either side of the join come out over-long - 53.35mm against 48.17 - and the
ring does not close.

**torus-octagonal is exactly this**: FACET 45, a 25 x 25mm section, and a
centreline octagon of circumradius 76.4696 whose facets sit at apothem 70.649.
Offset by +-12.5 that gives the airway apothems 58.149 and 83.149, which is
what that repository's own verifier reports out of its cut file. The render is
extrapolated from the cut file's numbers and agrees with them to 0.001mm.

`ribbon_view.py` draws a closed loop with no mouth and no far end, because the
last station is the first.

## The cheek gets its own file, and that file is cut twice

The two cheeks are the same part, so one file run twice is the whole job -
**but only if nothing else is on that sheet.** `pack()` used to fill the second
cheek's sheet with panels, so cutting one sheet twice left you thirteen panels
short with nothing to notice it but counting. `items_for()` emits ONE cheek and
`sheet()` packs cheeks and panels as separate groups:

    ...-cheek-x2-cut-files.svg     one cheek. Cut it twice.
    ...-panels-cut-files.svg       every wall panel. Cut once.

`x2` is the bell's convention - `bell-round10-...-x3-...` means three plies -
so the count of copies lives in the name, where a reader looking at a folder
finds it.

It also nests better: the serpentine went from three sheets to two, because the
panels no longer have to fit around a cheek.

## One sheet per bedful

`pack()` row-wraps into `BED - 2 x margin`, not into the bed. Filling to the
edge produced a sheet **600 x 307 on a 600 x 308 bed** — passes a fits-the-bed
check and cannot be positioned on a real machine. A part bigger than the usable
area is a refusal, not a smaller sheet.

## Kerf goes opposite ways on a part and on a hole

The laser removes `BURN` centred on the line, so a part comes out `BURN` under
and a hole `BURN` over. Every panel dimension is therefore drawn `BURN` **over**
and every slot `BURN` **under**, plus `PLAY` per side taken out of the slot and
never off the tab — `bore-generator`'s standing rule, and its 0.025mm figure for
the 10mm bore.

Measured back out of the written file rather than asserted: a 6.100mm drawn tab
and a 5.950mm drawn slot give a 6.000mm tab in a 6.050mm slot, 0.025mm a side.

## Both cheeks are the same part, and both go on the same way up

Outline, slots and engraving are identical - checked against the written files,
not assumed.

**Whether a flipped cheek would fit depends on the shape**, so `flippable()`
reports it and does not guess. The coupon's U *is* congruent to its own mirror:
turn it over, rotate 180 degrees, and every tab lands. The serpentine is not, at
any angle. The instruction is the same either way, because a flipped cheek
carries its numbers mirrored and facing into the bore - so one cheek always has
its numbers on the inside, which is the cheaper of the two mistakes.

That was documented backwards until 2026-09-03, on the strength of a test that
zipped two sorted point lists. **Sorting is unstable under a small
perturbation**: two nearly equal points swap order and every pair after them is
compared with the wrong partner. A 0.025mm difference read as 20.7mm of error
and answered the question the wrong way round. `flippable()` matches nearest
points as a bijection instead.

## The cheek stops 2mm outboard of its slots

`WEB`, not `MARGIN`, is the number to change — `MARGIN` is derived from it.
The band is `bore + 2 × (thickness/2 + WEB)`: 17mm at the 10mm bore. Asked for
"as thin as possible" and 2mm is the answer that still cuts; 1.5mm is the floor
in 3mm birch.

The knock-on is that there is no flange left to engrave on, so the cheek's
panel numbers moved **into the channel**, which is the floor of the bore. Two
checks hold that: no engraved point off its own part, and none inside a slot.

## Look at the render. The checks do not see the drawing

Two defects in this generator got through every check and were caught by
screenshotting the SVG:

- **Every glyph was mirrored top to bottom.** The glyph table's y runs up and
  SVG's runs down. A `2` came out as something that is not a `2`, and no
  geometric invariant cares.
- **The cheek's own number was engraved in the hole in the middle of the arch.**
  The centre of a U's bounding box is air.

`checks()` now includes *every engraved point is on its own part*, which found
the second one immediately — 18 points off, exactly the two cheek labels. It is
there because the render found it first. **Screenshot the SVG after any change
to drawing code.**

A third, from the same family: *no engraving lands in a slot* was written
comparing ink in sheet coordinates against slots rebuilt at design
coordinates. Two spaces that cannot overlap, so it passed, and the tell was
that it said **16 slots on a sheet that has 32**. A count printed beside a
verdict is what makes that visible. Both now come out of `sheet()`, which is
the only place that knows where anything was actually put.

Then it failed the same way again once there were several sheets: it compared
ink on sheet 3 against slots on sheet 1. Two sheets are two files and their
coordinates have nothing to do with each other. Both are now tagged with their
sheet. **Twice in one file is a pattern, not bad luck: any check comparing two
sets of coordinates must first establish what space they are both in.**

Every check reports its own count (`40 stations`, `504 points`, `120 pairs`) so
a check that measured nothing cannot print the same clean line as one that
measured everything.

## `id="..."` contains `d="..."`

Measuring the output with `re.findall(r'd="([^"]+)"')` matches the `id`
attribute too and hands you `slots` where a coordinate should be. Use
`(?:^|\s)d="`. `torus-octagonal`'s writeup records the same trap; it still cost
a run here.

**A failing run deletes its output**, which is right — a sheet that failed a
check should not be sitting there looking cuttable. It also means a copy of
this script tried out in this folder writes to, and then deletes, the real cut
file. That happened. Use `--out` for trials.

## `ribbon_view.py` draws the airway, not the plywood

One self-contained page per design, beside the cut files it belongs to, so the
thing you cut and the thing you turn around cannot drift apart. Same flags as
the generator.

**It draws the passage, bounded by the wall faces at ±bore/2 — not the parts.**
That is the whole reason it exists: the bore was cut 3mm narrow for a week and
nothing in this repository drew the space inside it. A picture of the plywood
would not have shown it; a picture of the airway would.

It reuses `offset()` for the wall faces rather than reading the cut files, so
it cannot disagree with the generator about where anything is. It is *not* the
lattice viewer in `bore-generator`: that one is built on integer cells and cube
faces with occupancy-based hidden-face removal, and there is no lattice here.

`--embed` writes a compact build for an iframe: canvas only, a caption, a slow
idle turn that stops on the first interaction and never starts under
`prefers-reduced-motion`. **The drawing code is extracted from the full page's
own `<script>` rather than copied**, so an embed cannot quietly diverge from
the page it links to. It drops three lines the embed declares for itself; the
first version sliced off the leading blank line instead, left `const D`
declared twice, and rendered a blank canvas.

`gernreich.github.io` embeds one. Regenerate it from here when the geometry
changes:

```sh
python3 ribbon_view.py --shape=serpentine --bore=25 --embed \
    --out=../Gernreich.github.io/bore-viewer.html \
    --home=https://gernreich.github.io/bore-ribbon/
```

An embed follows `prefers-color-scheme`, because it sits inside somebody
else's page. It cannot see an explicit theme toggle on the host — a frame is
its own document — so it matches by default and not after a manual switch.

**Nothing gates it.** `check.py`'s lesson from `bore-stretched` applies —
a render can be wrong while every check passes. Look at the page after changing
it.

## Previews, because a cut file is invisible on a page

`previews/` holds a readable rendering of every cut file, built by
`lasermade-tools/make-preview.py`. Same geometry, same cut order, thicker
strokes, and the three inks that fail contrast on a light ground darkened.
Rebuild them whenever a cut file changes — verified by comparing the path data,
which must be identical to the source.

## Colour is the cut order

Shared across all these repositories: **blue engraves, then green → orange →
cyan → black**; black frees the part; violet `#8000ff` means skip. This sheet
uses three — blue for the numbers, orange for the slots so the cheek is cut
while the sheet still holds it, black for the outlines.

## Cut files belong to the author

- **Stage by name.** Never `git add -A` or `git add .`.
- Do not regenerate a cut file the author has hand-edited without asking.
- Commit straight to `main`. Push only when asked.

## Commands

```sh
python3 ribbon_bore.py                 # cut file + the checks
python3 ribbon_bore.py --no-write      # the checks alone
python3 ribbon_bore.py --out=/tmp/x.svg   # a trial, somewhere it cannot hurt
python3 ribbon_view.py --shape=serpentine --bore=25    # the page you turn

for f in ribbon-*.svg; do
  python3 $G/make-preview.py "$f"       # previews/<name>, readable on a page
done

G=~/LaserMadeMusic/GIT/lasermade-tools
python3 $G/md2html.py README.md index.html

    --rebuild "python3 $G/md2html.py {md} {out}" --links
python3 $G/svg-stroke-check.py --dir . --quiet
```

**Read the audit output before pushing.** It ends with a pass/fail tally.
