# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Bores whose straight blocks are longer than their turns, and a fork of the toolchain that
cuts them. Straight blocks are 30mm long, turning blocks are 16mm cubes, and the airway is
10 x 10mm the whole way.

Four designs, each in its own folder with its own walk in `tools/walks/`. They are **one
coil truncated at its `N` spacers**, not four separate walks.

**A turn is four terms and a group is three, so they only agree at term 12.** That is the
one thing to get straight before touching any of this:

    term    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
    letter  W  U  E  D  W  U  E  D  W  U  E  D
            <- turn 1 ->  <- turn 2 ->  <- turn 3 ->
    N after       N        N        N        N
           [group 1] [group 2] [group 3] [group 4]

12 terms is three turns **and** four groups at once — the lowest common multiple. So the
longest coil is called `3t` and contains four groups, the reachable lengths are multiples of
¾ of a turn (0.75, 1.5, 2.25, 3), each group costs exactly 11 blocks, and only the fourth
group closes the cross-section because the first three stop mid-circuit. Two turns is eight
terms and no `N` lands there. Asking for 2 or 2.5 means moving the spacer, which makes a
different coil rather than a shorter one.

- **`coil-10x10x30-0.75t/`** — 11 blocks, 274mm, 3 sections. The shortest the walk goes.
  Uncut.
- **`coil-10x10x30-1.5t/`** — 22 blocks, 548mm. **All six parts are cut**; treat its files
  as describing wood. It arrived as a borrowed test from `../trumpet-switchback` and is that
  repository's walk exactly — nobody noticed it was a coil until the other two existed, which
  is why its folder was called `bore/` until 2026-09-01.
- **`coil-10x10x30-2.25t/`** — 33 blocks, 822mm, 9 sections. Uncut.
- **`coil-10x10x30-3t/`** — 44 blocks, 1096mm, and the longest. **Coils are named for the block and the
  number of full turns**: a 10 x 10mm airway on a 30mm straight, three times round. That is
  what differs between two coils before anything else does; the circuit size and the pitch
  live in the walk, not the name. Its page title comes from `--title`, not the folder — a
  folder has to sort and survive a URL, a title has to read. `WUED` repeated with an `N` spacer every three terms,
  which walks a square circuit in cross-section while stepping north. The first design laid
  out for this lattice. Nothing cut yet.

None of them is an instrument on its own: this repository is all bore, and nothing here
closes either end. The 10mm mouthpiece and bell in `../trumpet-switchback/10mm/` fit any of
them — a coil's mouth is a 10mm square in a 16mm face, which is what both seat onto, and
neither cares how long the bore behind it is. They are **named, not copied**: two copies of
a cut file drift, which has cost this project once already.

## The other repositories are FROZEN, with one exception so far

`../bore-generator` and every repository it cuts for — `../trumpet-coiled`,
`../trumpet-octagonal`, `../trumpet-parts`, `../trumpet-switchback` — keep the
scripts they were gated against. **Do not change them to suit this one.** That is why
`tools/` is a copy rather than an import, and why the generator installs as `SnakeBoxVar`
beside the frozen `SnakeBox` instead of over it.

**The exception, on 2026-09-01, is worth understanding because it is the shape a future
one would take.** `PIN_PLAY` was taken to 0.025 there too. It was not a change made to
suit this repository: the fit was *measured here*, four times in ply, and
`../trumpet-switchback` was carrying 0.3 — the value the bench had already rejected as
loose — in files someone might cut. The freeze protects the other repositories from
churn, not from evidence. Unfreezing was the author's call, and it should stay that way.

Two things follow:

- **Fixes do not flow back on their own.** Two files here already differ beyond the stretch.
  `tools/bore_split.py` has a tightened page-title rule, because the frozen one climbs past
  `bore-stretched` to the parent directory and titles the page "Git Bore Stretched Bore".
  `tools/viewer.py` draws each block from its real box rather than as a unit cube, and hides
  a face only where a neighbour measurably covers the whole of it — the frozen one culls by
  lattice index, which no longer exists here. If a fix matters over there, it has to be
  asked for, not assumed.

  The viewer is worth calling out because **nothing gates it**. `check.py` never looks at
  the page, so a render can be wrong while 194 checks pass — which is exactly what happened:
  the geometry, the plates and the voxel model were all correct and the picture still showed
  a uniform 10mm lattice. Look at the render after changing the geometry.
- **Check the freeze after touching Boxes.py.** Installing anything into `~/boxes` can
  disturb the shared checkout. The test is that the frozen toolchain still reproduces a
  shipped file byte for byte:

```sh
cd ../bore-generator
W="$(cat walks/trumpet_switchback.txt)"
~/boxes/venv/bin/python bore_split.py --blocksize=16 --refuse-elbows "$W" --write /tmp/f
cmp /tmp/f/02_bend_LUUR.svg ../trumpet-switchback/10mm/bore/02_bend_LUUR.svg
```

## A turn is a cube because it has to be

A turning block has two openings on two different faces, both of which must sit square in
the same frame. Stretch it along one axis and one opening comes out longer than the other.
So `--straight` lengthens straight blocks only, and `extent()` is the single place that
decides: long along the axis a block runs straight on, the section everywhere else.

## The lattice is not a grid any more, and that is the whole cost

The same column index wants 30mm in one part of the bore and 16mm in another, so **no single
number takes a lattice index to a millimetre**. Positions are carried in mm by
`block_boxes()`, each block butting its entry face onto the last block's exit face. For a
cubic cell that reproduces `index x blocksize` exactly — there is a test for it, and it is
the first thing to re-run if geometry looks wrong.

Everything downstream of that had to stop counting cells:

- `SnakeBoxVar.span()` sums the widths of the columns a boundary run crosses, instead of
  steps times one pitch. `bore_split.piece_widths()` supplies them, **rebased on the piece's
  first cell**, because SnakeBox lays its own cells out from (0,0) following `--path`.
- `assemble.build()` takes real boxes and decides face contact geometrically, so a face a
  neighbour only partly covers is walled over the rest of itself.
- `plate_span_mm()` sums column widths for the bed-fit test. It used to be `blocksize x
  blocks`, which under-reported by 13mm a side here.

**The grid still has to hold within a piece.** `piece_widths()` raises, naming the column,
when a straight and a turn share one — a plate is drawn on a rectilinear grid even though
the bore as a whole is not on one. This walk happens to satisfy it; most will not.

## The 1mm spurs are known, benign, and not worth fixing

Five of the six plates carry **four 1.00mm zero-width spurs** each: the cut path runs 1mm
past a corner and retraces the same line. Spotted on 2026-08-31 and deliberately left.

- **They cut into waste, not into the part.** Every spur tip tests outside the plate
  outline, so it is a slit in the offcut, not a nick in the piece. No dimension moves.
- **They are not from the stretched lattice.** The frozen 10mm bore in
  `../trumpet-switchback` has the identical 20, and its 25mm bore has none.
  They appear once the end frame drops below 12mm: zero at block 18 and above, four at 17
  and 16.
- **The cause is below this code.** The polygon `plateBorders()` hands over is clean — no
  negative or malformed lengths — so it is Boxes.py's edge drawing at a small frame.
  Narrowing the coupling does not help: at a 4.0mm notch there are still four, and at 4.6
  and 5.3 there are eight.

Section 1 is the only one with none, which is why the first part cut looked right.

**Do not "fix" this.** Chasing it means changing `~/boxes`, the shared checkout the frozen
repositories depend on, to remove a scorch mark in the waste.

## Do not trust a passing gate

194 checks and 0 failed is not the evidence. Two of those checks were vacuous on this
geometry until the voxel model was rewritten, and a passing gate means no check failed, not
that the part is buildable. The number that means something:

    voxelised bore volume   55520 mm3
    the same from the walk  55520 mm3     14 straights, 8 turns, corner voids

Two unrelated routes to one figure, exact against a 0.5% tolerance, with the passage coming
back as one region and no leak. If you change the geometry, re-derive that by hand and
compare — do not read the tally.

## Commands

```sh
cd tools
W="$(cat walks/stretched_test.txt)"
python3 bore_split.py --bore=10 --straight=30 --refuse-elbows "$W" --write ../bore
~/boxes/venv/bin/python check.py "$W" --bore=10 --straight=30 --files ../bore
C="$(cat walks/coil.txt)"
python3 bore_split.py --bore=10 --straight=30 --refuse-elbows "$C" --write ../coil
```

**Tune the fit with `PIN_PLAY`. Do not move the tab.** Two standing decisions, both the
author's:

- **One tab size and one notch size across the whole bore.** Every joint is the same joint.
  A fix that leaves one seam different from the rest is not a fix.
- **Adjust by narrowing the notch, never by widening the tab.** The tab is the finger-tooth
  width and the load-bearing half; a notch is a hole. `--notch` exists and would move the
  tab to suit — this design does not use it.

Sized on the bench over four goes, all 2026-08-31:

| clearance | outcome |
| ---: | --- |
| 0.0mm | would not go together at all |
| 0.3mm | went together, perceptible rock |
| 0.1mm | very slightly loose |
| **0.05mm** | current: tab 6.0, notch 6.05 — **confirmed on the bench**, parts 1 and 2 fit themselves and each other |

The 0.1mm round widened the tab to 6.2 and held the notch at 6.3, because parts 1 and 2
were cut and a cut notch cannot be narrowed. That left two tab sizes in one bore. The
author chose to recut instead, which is what restored a single size.

**Before changing this again, ask what is already cut.** A regenerate that moves a joint
leaves parts in wood that no file describes — and if recutting is on the table, say so,
because it decides whether the tab may return to its natural width.

`--bore` is the airway and `--blocksize` is the outside; they differ by two wall
thicknesses and confusing them is the mistake this switch exists to stop. `check.py` needs
**the same two switches** as the writer or it gates a design nobody cut — `--files` looks
only at the sheets as the machine sees them and never at the geometry.

`bore_split.py --write` calls the gate itself, but `check.py` imports **shapely**, which is
not in `/usr/bin/python3`. Run as a script it writes all six files and then dies on the
import, files written and ungated. Use the Boxes.py venv.

## One viewer, one or several coils

`viewer.build_many([(label, walk), ...], title)` is the only page builder. `build()` is it
with a single item, and a single item hides the selector, so a per-coil page is what it
always was. `tools/coils.py` passes four and writes `coils.html`.

That is deliberate: a gallery is **more sets in the same viewer**, not a second viewer. Two
templates would drift, and the drawing code is the part that has been wrong before.

**The scale is locked to the longest coil, not fitted to whichever is shown.** Fitting each
one to the canvas drew four coils the same size, which is the one thing a page comparing
lengths must not do. `draw()` takes its **scale** from the reference set and its
**position** from the set on screen, so the ¾ draws at 0.485 of the 3-turn and stays
centred. That ratio is bounding box, not centreline: the centrelines are 274mm and 1096mm,
a factor of four, but a coil folds, so its box grows more slowly than its length.

The switch therefore **keeps** the camera. It used to reset, and it had to when each coil
fitted itself — a zoom held from the 3-turn threw the ¾ off-screen. Nothing can leave the
frame now, and holding the angle is the point: you are comparing lengths, which you cannot
do if the view jumps each time you swap. Reset is still a button.

## `regress.py` gates both designs, and what it cannot see

```sh
cd tools && ~/boxes/venv/bin/python regress.py        # both designs
cd tools && ~/boxes/venv/bin/python regress.py coil   # one
```

The frozen corpus in `../bore-generator` gates the frozen toolchain and has no stretched
lattice in it, so it cannot catch a change made here. Each design carries the switches it is
cut with, because `--files` never looks at the pitch and will happily gate a design nobody
is cutting.

**It bites.** Adding 1mm to `SnakeBoxVar.span()` fails both designs and names the sections.

**It has one blind spot, and it is the interesting one.** `extent()` decides how long a
straight block is, and `check.py` computes the expected bore volume from that same function.
Break `extent` and the measured volume and the expected volume move together, so the check
that looks strongest here cannot see it: adding 1mm to every straight block still passes
392 checks. What the volume check proves is that the voxel model agrees with the formula,
not that either is right. **A change to `extent()` has to be checked by hand.**

`bore/` describes cut parts. A rebuild that changes it needs asking about first.

**After editing `README.md`** — regenerate the page, then audit:

```sh
G=../lasermade-tools
python3 $G/md2html.py README.md index.html
python3 $G/doc-audit.py README.md --html index.html
python3 $G/svg-stroke-check.py --dir . --quiet
```

## Cut files belong to the author

The author edits SVGs in Inkscape during a session. **Stage by name** — never `git add -A`.
A changed section length renames a file and the generator does not delete what it stops
writing, so check `bore/` for orphans after a regenerate.

## Colour is the cut order

**Blue engraves, then green -> orange -> cyan -> black**; black frees the part, violet
`#8000ff` means skip.
