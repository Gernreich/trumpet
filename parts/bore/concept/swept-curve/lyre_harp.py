"""A lyre-harp frame as one closed duct whose width changes round the loop.

ribbon_bore.py builds every duct as two walls offset a fixed bore either side of
ONE centreline, so its section is the same all the way round. This one is not.
The walls are two independent closed outlines, drawn from the author's sketch
(a rough lyre-harp.svg, since deleted) as redrawn and approved on 2026-09-16:

  * the OUTER outline, a stadium 400mm long -- a half-circle at each end and
    two parallel sides;
  * the HOLE, where the strings go: a half-circle concentric with the outer
    one, parallel sides, and a bottom of two tangent corners with a small bump
    rising into the hole between them.

Between them runs the air. Over the arch and down the parallel sides the two
walls stand a bore apart, so the duct there is BORE x BORE, 30 x 30mm. Below
the hole the walls part: the duct is still BORE deep, cheek to cheek, but as
wide as the gap between the hole's bottom and the outer bottom -- the
resonator, about 200mm across.

Everything that is a part -- the panel with its teeth, the mortice, the
engraved number, the packing, the sheet and its colours, the ring cheek cut as
two contours -- is ribbon_bore's own, imported and not copied. What is new is
only what a single centreline could not describe: the two outlines, which way
is out from each, and the checks that assumed a constant bore.

# KERF, the full width the laser takes out, for THIS instrument only. 0.13 is
# the MEASURED beam, ribbon_bore.py's own figure from 2026-09-09. It is not a
# fit knob and nothing here may move it to chase a joint.
#
# FIT is the fit knob, and it is the whole history of this instrument in one
# number. The test came off the bed with LOOSE FINGER JOINTS, so the kerf was
# raised to 0.17, then to 0.20 (2026-09-20, both on the author's instruction) --
# which tightened the joints because an overstated kerf draws tabs fat and
# mortices thin, but it also drew every OTHER line in the design 0.07 out,
# outlines oversize and holes undersize, the band, the duct and the knot cuts
# with them. So the kerf goes back to the truth and the interference moves to
# the two constants that exist for it, leaving the joints exactly where 0.20 put
# them. FIT is the kerf the JOINTS are cut as if, and nothing else reads it.
#
# 0.20 -> 0.25 the same day, on the author's instruction: they are after a
# FRICTION FIT, one that needs a rubber mallet to close, and are walking the
# test piece up to it. That is +0.19mm of interference along the tooth and
# +0.12 across the ply, against +0.09 and +0.07 at 0.20. Use --fit= to try a
# value; move this default when one is to be cut, so the sheets on disk and
# the number in the source never disagree about what is on the bench.
KERF = 0.13
FIT = 0.25
# Why those two lines below, and not one. Write D = FIT - KERF. Along the tooth
# BOTH sides of the joint are drawn, so overstating the kerf fattens the tab by
# D and thins the notch by D: 2D of interference. Across the ply only the notch
# is drawn -- the other half of that joint is the plywood, which no kerf can
# grow -- so the same D buys D. One lever cannot pay 2:1 and 1:1 at once.
# SLOT_TIGHTEN comes off the notch in both directions, so it settles the depth;
# the width is then short by D, and half of that comes off the clearance a side.
# It takes PLAY NEGATIVE, at -0.01, and that is the honest reading and not a
# trick: there is no clearance left in this joint, there is interference, and a
# negative clearance per side is what that sentence means in a number.
# Verified against the 0.20 sheets before the change: width +0.090mm and depth
# +0.070mm of interference both ways, and the mortice even lands on the same
# 2.80mm drawn depth.
# Functions, not constants, because --fit= moves FIT at run time and a value
# worked out at import would go on answering for the old one. _PLAY0 is caught
# at import instead, before build() overwrites B.PLAY_UNMEASURED with the
# figure below -- read from ribbon_bore rather than written out again, since the
# clearance this reduces is ITS number and a copied 0.025 would go on saying

    The panels go in while the front plate lies face DOWN, which puts the
    numbers already on it against the table. Engraving lives on whichever face
    was up in the machine and no amount of mirroring moves it through the ply,
    so the numbers have to be put on the other face in a second, cut-free pass.

    THE PART IS WHAT MAKES THIS WORK. cheek() is mirror-symmetric about the
    instrument's long axis -- 49 outline points and all 115 mortices have their
    mirror, checked below -- so the plate can be turned over about that axis
    and lands back on its own footprint. FLIPPED THE OTHER WAY IT WILL NOT: the
    string hole is not symmetric end for end, and that is the mistake this file
    can neither detect nor survive.

    So each label is reflected y -> -y and its angle negated, while label()
    goes on drawing readable glyphs: mirrored placement, unmirrored digits.
