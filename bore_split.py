"""Split a bore written in the agreed notation into cuttable part files.

World axes: +X right, +Y up, +Z toward you.

    N S  away / toward you    E W  east / west    U D  up / down
    (facing north, east is on your right)

    <entry> <run> <run> ... <exit>

    You walk the tunnel's centreline.

        first   the way you are facing at the tunnel mouth
        N.5     half a block in, to the centre of block 1 (second term)
        E       re-point east, standing in the block you are already in
        E2      move two blocks east
        E.5     half a block out, leaving through that face (last term)

    You leave facing whatever direction you last pointed. A trailing letter is
    therefore optional: repeating your heading is a no-op, but naming a new one
    turns the final block into an elbow and you exit that way.

    A bare letter costs no block: the turn happens inside the block you
    arrived at. So the tunnel is 1 + the sum of the numbers blocks long, and
    every block where the heading changes is an elbow.

        D E1 S          elbow(D->E), straight 1, elbow(E->S)
        D E4 U2 E6 S    4 elbows and 3 straights

    A bare heading in the middle is rejected: it would mean two elbows butted
    with no run between, which is only sound when both turns lie in the same
    plane. Write U1 if you really want a one-cell jog.

Every elbow is the same part whichever way it turns, so a bore needs one elbow
file plus one file per distinct run length.

    python3 bore_split.py "D R1 F"              report only
    python3 bore_split.py "D R1 F" --write DIR  also cut the files

    python3 bore_split.py "D R1 F" --blocksize=16    a smaller bore: the
        pitch is the sound square plus two walls, so 16 is 10mm of air in 3mm
        stock, where the default 31 is 25mm of air. Pass the same number to
        check.py or the gate measures the wrong design.

# fit before you add char, glue or any kerf the burn allowance did not predict.
# Reported from the bench 2026-08-31: section 1 would not enter section 2. This
# widens the notch only -- the tab keeps its full width and strength.
#
# Measured, per bore, and NOT modelled. Two sizes have been cut and assembled:
#
#     bore 25mm (tab 12.0 in a 25mm frame)   0.0   assembles, fits well
#     bore 10mm (tab  6.0 in a 10mm frame)   0.05  assembles, fits well
#                                            0.0   will not go together
#                                            0.1   very slightly loose
#                                            0.3   perceptible rock
#
# The same zero clearance that jams the small joint is fine on the large one, so
# the requirement is not absolute and not a constant.
#
# The 10mm bore is not merely a small size, it is the extreme one. Work pin_width
# across every bore and the two rules cross at exactly 10mm: the tab is a full
# finger-joint tooth AND the shoulder is at its 2mm minimum, both at once. Below
# 10mm the tab has to be cut narrower than a tooth to keep any shoulder. And the
# shoulder there is 2.00mm in 3mm ply -- 0.67 of a ply, a short-grain sliver --
# against 6.50mm, or 2.17 plies, at 25mm.
#
# What the two points rule out: required clearance FALLS as the joint grows. A
# constant absolute clearance would want the same figure at both; a constant
# fraction of the tab would want more at 25mm, not less. Both are contradicted.
# What fits the direction is a fabrication error that does not scale -- kerf,
# ply thickness, positioning, all fixed in millimetres -- against elastic take-up
# that does, so the larger joint absorbs what the smaller cannot. Hypothesis, not
# result. (Note the shoulder-stiffness reading has a sign problem: a narrower
# shoulder is less stiff and should spread more easily, making the small joint
# easier to close, not harder. It only explains the jam if the sliver splits
# rather than flexes.)
#
# The test that would settle it needs no bore: cut a coupon of the two mating end
# frames at 16mm, where the tab is 7.68mm and the 48% fraction binds, at 0.0,
# 0.0125 and 0.025 per side. If take-up scales, the middle one fits.
#
# --play cuts it. The walk is the shortest two-section one with no elbows, so
# the sheet carries the joint and almost nothing else:
#
#   W="N N2 U3 E3 E"
#   for pl in 0 0.0125 0.025; do
#     bore_split.py --blocksize=22 --play=$pl --refuse-elbows "$W" \
#         --write ../test/coupon-16mm/play-$pl
#   done
#
# 22mm block is the 16mm bore, and --pin_width comes out at 7.68mm, which is the
# figure this paragraph is about. Measured across the three runs: only section 1
# changes, by exactly the play at each notch edge, and section 2 is identical in
# all three -- because play is taken out of the notch and never off the tab. So
# cut section 2 once, cut section 1 three times, and try each against it.
#
# Whichever fits, add the row to PLAY_BY_BORE and delete --play from the recipe:
# the table is what has been measured, and the flag exists to measure.
#
# So this is a lookup of what has been cut, not a curve through it. A bore that
# is not in the table gets the small-joint value, because that is the safe
# direction -- too loose is a worse joint, too tight is no joint at all. Measure
# it and add a row rather than trusting the fallback.
