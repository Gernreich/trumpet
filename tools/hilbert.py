"""Write a Hilbert cube as a walk in the bore notation.

A Hilbert curve visits every cell of a 2^n cube exactly once, in unit steps,
which makes it the densest bore the notation can describe: no cell of the box
is wasted. Order 1 is 8 blocks in a 2x2x2, order 2 is 64 in a 4x4x4, order 3 is
512 in an 8x8x8.

It is also the most expensive to cut. A space-filling curve turns almost every
block, and a block that turns is a corner, so an order-2 cube comes out as 63
sections for 64 blocks.
