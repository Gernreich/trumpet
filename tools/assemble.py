"""Fold a section up in three dimensions and see whether it closes.

Every other check tests a proxy - part counts, edge lengths, tooth spacing.
This builds the section as a solid and asks the question directly: is the bore
sealed everywhere except at the openings it is supposed to have?

The parts are placed as the box actually assembles: the two face plates fill
the piece's outline over the material's thickness at each face, set in wherever
a wall sits; the walls stand between them, a thickness wide, along every
boundary run that is not an opening. Then the openings are plugged and the
outside is flooded. If the flood reaches the bore, something is missing.
