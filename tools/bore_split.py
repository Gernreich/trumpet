"""Split a bore written in the agreed notation into cuttable part files.

World axes: +X right, +Y up, +Z toward you.

    N S  away / toward you    E W  east / west    U D  up / down
    (facing north, east is on your right)

    <entry> <run> <run> ... <exit>

    You walk the tunnel's centreline.

        first   the way you are facing at the tunnel mouth
        N.5     half a block in, to the centre of block 1 (second term)
        E       re-point east, standing in the block you are already in
        E2      move two blocks east
        E.5     half a block out, leaving through that face (last term)

    You leave facing whatever direction you last pointed. A trailing letter is
    therefore optional: repeating your heading is a no-op, but naming a new one
    turns the final block into an elbow and you exit that way.

    A bare letter costs no block: the turn happens inside the block you
    arrived at. So the tunnel is 1 + the sum of the numbers blocks long, and
    every block where the heading changes is an elbow.

        D E1 S          elbow(D->E), straight 1, elbow(E->S)
        D E4 U2 E6 S    4 elbows and 3 straights

    A bare heading in the middle is rejected: it would mean two elbows butted
    with no run between, which is only sound when both turns lie in the same
    plane. Write U1 if you really want a one-cell jog.

Every elbow is the same part whichever way it turns, so a bore needs one elbow
file plus one file per distinct run length.

    python3 bore_split.py "D R1 F" --bore=10 --straight=30
        straights 30mm long with the turns left cubic, so the bore lengthens
        without the walk changing. The cross-section stays square either way.
    python3 bore_split.py "D R1 F" --blocksize=16    a smaller bore: the
        pitch is the sound square plus two walls, so 16 is 10mm of air in 3mm
        stock, where the default 31 is 25mm of air. Pass the same number to
        check.py or the gate measures the wrong design.
